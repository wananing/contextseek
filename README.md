Semantic context infrastructure for AI agents. [中文文档](README_CN.md)

## Overview

Agent self-evolution is taking shape along two technical paths. One extracts and solidifies experience from runtime behavior (e.g. [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), [OpenHuman](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman)). The other evolves the **context infrastructure** beneath the agent—organizing, updating, and linking context automatically—without modifying agent execution logic.

ContextSeek focuses on the latter. It turns one-off, task-level gains into compounding value across context lifecycles, so heterogeneous agent systems can share a single semantic layer for retrieval, provenance, and evolution.

Three constraints still stand in the way: **heterogeneous integration**—Memory, Trace, and related components expose incompatible APIs and semantic conventions; **insufficient retention**—runtime experience is consumed in the prompt window and rarely becomes reusable capability; **missing provenance**—outputs lack traceable evidence chains. ContextSeek is a unified semantic context layer between LLMs and agent runtimes, converging these capabilities in a single object model: everything is a `ContextItem`, retrievable and traceable, with automatic progression through `raw → extracted → knowledge → skill`.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install contextseek
```

```python
from contextseek import ContextSeek

ctx = ContextSeek.from_settings()  # reads .env or environment variables

# Write
ctx.add(
    "OceanBase is a financial-grade distributed database supporting HTAP workloads",
    scope="acme/db/engineer",
    source="wiki",
)

# Retrieve (ranked SearchHits; L1 summaries by default)
for hit in ctx.retrieve("distributed database", scope="acme/db/engineer", k=10):
    text = hit.item.summary or hit.item.content
    print(f"[{hit.item.stage.value}] score={hit.score:.2f} | {text[:100]}")
```

Configure via `.env` (see [.env.example](.env.example)) or `ContextSeekSettings` in code. A storage backend, an embedding provider, and an LLM are the three required pieces.

## How it works

- **Unified object model** — all context — memory, knowledge, traces, skills — is a `ContextItem`. Items carry mandatory `Provenance` (source type, source id, confidence) and typed `Link` edges (supports, refutes, derives, supersedes), enabling a full `EvidenceChain` DAG with confidence propagation.
- **Content tiers** — L0 (~100 tokens) feeds embedding recall. L1 (~2 k tokens) is the default surface returned by `retrieve()`. L2 (full body) is available on demand via `expand()`.
- **Retrieval orchestrator** — keyword + vector hybrid recall, optional LLM reranking, and scope-based routing. Returns ranked `SearchHit` rows. Exposes tool specs for OpenAI and Anthropic agents via `ctx.tools()`.
- **EvolutionEngine** — watches for items that can be merged, resolved, advanced in stage, or distilled into skills. Runs incrementally after writes or on an explicit `compact()` call.
- **DreamEngine** — idle-time pattern consolidation and cross-cluster hypothesis generation, triggered via `dream()`.
- **HTTP + MCP servers** — expose the same operations over FastAPI and the Model Context Protocol for remote agent integrations.
